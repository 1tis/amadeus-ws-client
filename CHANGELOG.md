* Implemented checking for response errors for all supported messages _except Command_Cryptic_. For Command_Cryptic, you need to parse the response yourself to check for errors.
* Removed the 'asString' request option - the `Amadeus\Client\Result` object now always contains the result XML in the `responseXml` property.

# 2016-05

Completely re-worked the Result being returned by Web Service calls: the XML or PHP object is now encapsulated in an `Amadeus\Client\Result` object which makes checking for errors or warnings much easier. 

The library now always returns both the PHP object generated by `\SoapClient` as well as the result string. 

The Result object also has a `status` property which contains the status of the message performed: FATAL, OK, WARN or INFO. 

The library will now also convert `\SoapFault` exceptions to a FATAL result status.
